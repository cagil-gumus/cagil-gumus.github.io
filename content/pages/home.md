Hi. 

I program FPGAs for a living. 

I'll try to share interesting things here.

Anyway here is a picture of me and my dogs. Neo on the left and Titan on my lap.

I'm going to use this place to rant about things. Talk about the stuff I'm passionate about.

Topics such as: 

* What is the goal function of life? 
* FPGAs
* Solutions to Fermi Paradox and why we should expand inward
* Importance of NATO
* Things related to Turkey. (Might write this in Turkish tbh) 
* Cannabis Cultivation

I swear I'm fun at parties.



Here is my band at work:
