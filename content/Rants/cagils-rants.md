I tried Jekyll for so long and I still didn't manage to make something meaningful. If this also doesn't work out, I'm going to lose my fucking mind. 

Anyway here is a picture of me and my dogs. Neo on the left and Titan on my lap.

I'm going to use this place to rant about things. Talk about the stuff I'm passinate about.


Topics such as: 

* What is the goal function of life? 
* FPGAs
* Solutions to Fermi Paradox and why we should expand inward
* Importance of NATO
* Things related to Turkey. (Might write this in Turkish tbh) 
* Cannabis Cultivation

I swear I'm fun at parties.
